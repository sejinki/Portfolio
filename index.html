        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I graduated with my English Degree in 2020 from BYU- Idaho. I can speak Korean and Samoan with a desire to learn Mandarin, German, and French. <br>
            Wells Fargo has been my place of employment for a little over two years now. I work for their Fraud department as their Lead Fraud and Claims Specialist. <br>
            I played volleyball and ran hurdles in high school. I still continue to play volleyball any chance I get. My new favorite sport to play is Pickleball and slowly <br>
            getting into rock climbing. I love to work out and being outdoors. I love to travel and have been to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. I am hoping to <br>
            cross off Italy, Greece, and South Korea off my bucket-list. I am a quick learner and motivated to do my best work. I work well with others and have a good <br>
            sense of humor.
